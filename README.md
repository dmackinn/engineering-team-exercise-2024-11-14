# Team Exercise Nov 15, 2024

## What is this?

The Searchcraft engineering team often does small coding exercises together to compare solutions that we may come up with for a problem. These exercises are scoped to be completed in an hour or less.  The focus is sharing together the process of solving the problem and to highlight creativity. As the goal is to complete something with an hour, there are times when the solution may not be fully functional.

## Exercise Parameters

- Build a Tauri app of your choice. You must write rust code, not just JS.

## How to run this project

```bash
npm i
npm run tauri dev
```

## Details about my solution

I chose Typescript / SolidJS for the frontend. I built a hack and slash game called Wraithspire where a player progresses through a dungeon and fights monsters. Since this was timeboxed there were more things that I wanted to attempt such as adding background music and placing more restrictions on what the player could do while encounrtering monsters but I ran out of time.
