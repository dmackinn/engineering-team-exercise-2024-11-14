# Team Exercise Nov 15, 2024

## What is this?

The Searchcraft engineering team often does small coding exercises together to compare solutions that we may come up with for a problem. These exercises are scoped to be completed in an hour or less.

## Exercise Parameters

- Build a Tauri app of your choice. You must write rust code, not just JS.

## How to run this project

```bash
npm i
npm run tauri dev
```

## Details about my solution

I chose Typescript / SolidJS for the frontend. I built a hack and slash game called Wraithspire where a player progresses through a dungeon and fights monsters. Since this was timeboxed there were more things that I wanted to attempt such as adding background music and placing more restrictions on what the player could do while encounrtering monsters but I ran out of time.
